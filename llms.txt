# ValueFlows - Comprehensive LLM.txt

ValueFlows (VF) is a comprehensive open-source vocabulary for distributed economic networks designed to coordinate the creation, distribution, and exchange of economic resources. This document provides extensive technical information for AI language models about the ValueFlows ontology, implementation patterns, and ecosystem.

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: ValueFlows is "a vocabulary for the distributed economic networks of the next economy, to coordinate the creation, distribution, and exchange of economic resources."

**Mission**: Enable internetworking among different software projects for resource planning and accounting within fractal networks of people and groups. The focus is on facilitating groups experimenting with solidarity, cooperative, collaborative, commons-based peer production, and transitional economies.

## Philosophy and Core Principles

### Fractal Economic Networks
ValueFlows supports fractal network structures where economic activities can be nested and coordinated at multiple scales - from individual transactions to large organizational networks. This enables:
- **Multi-scale coordination**: Individual, group, organizational, and network-level economic planning
- **Flexible boundaries**: Economic activities can cross traditional organizational boundaries
- **Emergent organization**: Bottom-up coordination through shared vocabularies

### Technology Agnostic Design
The vocabulary is designed to work across different technical platforms:
- **RDF/Linked Data**: Primary specification format with semantic web integration
- **GraphQL**: Query-focused API design with type safety
- **JSON**: Lightweight implementation for web applications
- **SQL/NoSQL**: Database-agnostic storage patterns
- **Blockchain**: Distributed ledger implementations (experimental)

### Economic Model Independence
ValueFlows doesn't prescribe specific economic models but provides vocabulary for:
- **Market economies**: Traditional buyer/seller relationships
- **Gift economies**: One-way flows without direct reciprocity
- **Commons-based**: Shared resource management and stewardship
- **Cooperative**: Member-owned and democratically controlled organizations
- **Hybrid models**: Combinations of different economic logics

## Technical Foundation

**Ontology Base**: Built on the REA (Resources, Events, Agents) ontology, first defined by Professor William McCarthy of Michigan State University in 1982. Extended with concepts from:
- **ISO 15944-4**: Business transaction patterns
- **UN/CEFACT**: Supply chain and trade facilitation
- **Schema.org**: Web-compatible vocabulary patterns
- **FOAF**: Social network vocabularies for agents

**Technical Specifications**:
- **Namespace**: `https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#` (preferred prefix: `vf`)
- **Formats**: TTL (Turtle), JSON-LD, HTML, GraphQL Schema, JSON Schema
- **System of Record**: Turtle (.ttl) file with formal ontology definitions
- **Version Control**: Git-based development with semantic versioning
- **Testing**: Automated validation with ontology reasoners and example data

**Quality Assurance**:
- Ontology validation using HermiT and Pellet reasoners
- Example data validation against schemas
- Cross-format consistency checking
- Community review process for changes

## Advanced Implementation Patterns

### Recipe-Based Planning

ValueFlows supports recipe systems for repeatable processes:

```yaml
# Process Specification Example
ProcessSpecification:
  name: "Bread Baking"
  processClassifiedAs: "http://example.org/processes/Baking"
  note: "Standard recipe for whole wheat bread"

# Resource Specifications
ResourceSpecifications:
  - name: "Whole Wheat Flour"
    defaultUnit: "kilogram"
    resourceClassifiedAs: "http://example.org/ingredients/flour"
  - name: "Fresh Bread Loaf"
    defaultUnit: "loaf"
    resourceClassifiedAs: "http://example.org/products/bread"

# Recipe as Process with typical flows
RecipeFlows:
  inputs:
    - resourceSpec: "Whole Wheat Flour"
      action: "consume"
      resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 0.5, unit: "kilogram" }
    - resourceSpec: "Baker Labor"
      action: "work"
      effortQuantity: { numericValue: 2, unit: "hour" }
  outputs:
    - resourceSpec: "Fresh Bread Loaf"
      action: "produce"
      resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 1, unit: "loaf" }
```

### Multi-Party Exchange Patterns

Complex exchanges involving multiple parties and resources:

```yaml
# Agreement between bakery cooperative members
Agreement:
  name: "Weekly Bread Share Agreement"
  involvedAgents: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Bakery Coop"]

# Commitments from agreement
Commitments:
  # Members provide ingredients
  - provider: "Alice"
    receiver: "Bakery Coop"
    action: "give"
    resourceSpec: "Wheat Flour"
    resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 2, unit: "kilogram" }
    due: "2024-01-15T08:00:00Z"
  
  # Coop provides finished bread
  - provider: "Bakery Coop"
    receiver: "Alice"
    action: "give"
    resourceSpec: "Fresh Bread"
    resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 3, unit: "loaf" }
    due: "2024-01-15T18:00:00Z"
```

### Supply Chain Traceability

Track resources through complex supply chains:

  name: "Grain Milling - Batch 001"
  hasBeginning: "2024-01-10T09:00:00Z"
  hasEnd: "2024-01-10T11:00:00Z"

# Input event (consume grain)
EconomicEvent:
  action: "consume"
  inputOf: "Grain Milling - Batch 001"
  resourceInventoriedAs: "grain-batch-2024-001"
  resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 1000, unit: "kilogram" }
  provider: "Sunny Acres Farm"
  receiver: "Valley Mill Coop"

# Output event (produce flour)
EconomicEvent:
  action: "produce"
  outputOf: "Grain Milling - Batch 001"
  resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 800, unit: "kilogram" }
  provider: "Valley Mill Coop"
  receiver: "Valley Mill Coop"
  # New resource created with traceability link
  resourceInventoriedAs: "flour-batch-2024-001"
```

### Commons Resource Management

Model shared resource pools and stewardship:

```yaml
# Shared tool library
EconomicResource:
  resourceSpecification: "Power Drill Set"
  accountingQuantity: { numericValue: 1, unit: "set" }
  containedIn: "Community Tool Library"
  currentLocation: "Neighborhood Center"

# Usage by community member
EconomicEvent:
  action: "use"
  provider: "Tool Library Commons"
  receiver: "Bob (member)"
  resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 1, unit: "set" }
  hasBeginning: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  hasEnd: "2024-01-15T16:00:00Z"
  note: "Building raised garden bed"

# Return after use
EconomicEvent:
  action: "give"
  provider: "Bob (member)"
  receiver: "Tool Library Commons"
  resourceQuantity: { numericValue: 1, unit: "set" }
  hasPointInTime: "2024-01-15T16:30:00Z"
```

### Time Banking and Mutual Aid

Model time-based exchanges and mutual aid networks:

```yaml
