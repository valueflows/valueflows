# Status of the vocabulary

This documentation is for release 0.16. [Change log can be found here](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/src/branch/master/CHANGELOG.md).  Notable for the current status is that we are removing unstable pieces of the model, in order to publish a 1.0.0 version.  The most important one is removal of non-operational and pre-operational features, centered around Scenario. We also removed the agent relationship model, which can be considered out of scope of the core economic model for now. All documentation of any feature removed is in the [git issues](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/issues), labeled `Removed 1.0`.  These features will continue to be worked on, in collaboration with user groups implementing them, and will be targeted for future releases.

This vocabulary is based on decades of work in academia and several implementations in the field.  The core model being published is considered stable.  However, there are also many known and unknown edge cases and possibly not-so-edge cases where the model will need to be enhanced for the reality in the field. Also, this model represents something new, something that we want to be able to support the next economy, with all the unknowns that will bring.

So we see continuous improvements happening as the vocabulary is adopted by more people, through ongoing collaboration between the VF team and the adopters.
