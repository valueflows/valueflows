# Status of the vocabulary

This documentation is for release 1.0.0, a major stable release.  The scope is operational planning and observation of economic activity. [Change log can be found here](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/src/branch/master/CHANGELOG.md){target="_blank"}.

Notable for this first major release is that we have removed unstable pieces of the model, defined as not having enough testing in the field.  The most important one is removal of non-operational and pre-operational features, such as bioregional planning and analysis. We also removed the agent relationship model, which can be considered out of scope of the core economic model for now, and a few properties. All documentation of any feature removed is in the [git issues](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/issues){target="_blank"}.  These features will continue to be worked on, in collaboration with user groups implementing them, and will be targeted for future releases.

This vocabulary is based on decades of work in academia and several implementations in the field.  The core model being published is considered stable.  However, there are also many known and unknown edge cases and possibly not-so-edge cases where the model will need to be enhanced for the reality in the field. Also, this model represents something new, something that we want to be able to support the next economy, with all the unknowns that will bring.  So we do see continuous improvements happening as the vocabulary is adopted by more people, through ongoing collaboration between the VF team and the adopters.

That said, we will support stable major releases and backwards compatibility for a reasonable time period (using the [SemVer numbering system](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html){target="_blank"}).
