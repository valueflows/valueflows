![Value Flows](assets/VF-logo-heading.jpg)
## *Valueflows (VF) is a vocabulary for the distributed economic networks of the next economy, to coordinate the creation, distribution, and exchange of economic resources.*

<hr/>

Here are some suggestions to help you find your way into this documentation, depending on your specific interest and level of prior understanding.

* **For a high level understanding of what Valueflows is and what it is for**, please start with this [**introductory summary**](introduction/introduction.md).  You could also check into what other groups are doing with Valueflows in the [**reference implementations**](appendix/usedfor.md), or take a peek at the [**algorithms overview**](algorithms/overview.md) for more possibilities.

* **To learn about the vocabulary itself**, you could start with the [**high-level description of the core model**](introduction/core.md), and then continue as you like in these directions...

      * For the more visually oriented or people who like diagrams, head to the [**UML diagram**](specification/uml.md).

      * Whether or not you look at the diagram, see these [**class and relationship explanations by subject area**](specification/model-text.md), which also point to the related [**concepts pages**](concepts/concepts-overview.md).  Or just go straight to the [**concepts section**](concepts/concepts-overview.md).

      * For even more gory details, check the rest of the [**specification pages**](specification/spec-overview.md), and/or [**examples section**](examples/ex-overview.md).

* **Or if you want a more fun and friendly way to understand the vocabulary**, you can start here with a [**Valueflows story about apple pie, yum!**](assets/ValueFlows-Story.pdf).

* **To lookup specific details**, you can use the *Search* function above.  Definitions and relationships by data element (class, property, etc.) are linked on the first [**formatted spec here**](specification/all_vf.html); and are textually [**described by subject area here**](specification/model-text.md).  The [**concepts section**](concepts/concepts-overview.md) and [**examples section**](examples/ex-overview.md) also might be helpful to lookup developer level information.

You can find the repository here on [**codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows), also mirrored on [**github**](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows).

Or come on over and say hello or ask questions in [**matrix element**](https://matrix.to/#/#valueflows:matrix.org).
