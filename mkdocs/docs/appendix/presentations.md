# Other Available Documentation

We are occasionally asked for other documentation and visuals for Valueflows.  We'll keep adding below as new things become available.  We also appreciate projects contributing graphics and other useful presentations back to the Valueflows community, and we will add them here. 

## Graphics in this documentation

Most of the graphics on these VF website pages are available in xml (for drawing tools) and as images here:

* [images in the main documentation](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/src/branch/master/mkdocs/docs/assets)
* [images on the example pages](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/src/branch/master/mkdocs/docs/assets/examples)
