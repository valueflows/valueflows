# Provenance

Provenance is a form of tracing the origins of some end state. The term is often used for scientific papers or for valuable assets like artworks or diamonds.

From [PROV Overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/): "Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness." Provenance traces the history of an artifact, its processes and inputs, their processes and inputs, etc.  (We did look at PROV when we wanted to have Valueflows, but it was not enough for the need.)
