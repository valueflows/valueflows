# Concepts Overview

*All of the Concepts sections are non-normative.*

These concept pages are organized by topic within Valueflows.

We recommend you read the [introductory core concepts](../introduction/core.md) first, before digging into these more detailed concept documents.

Another path to these concepts is from the [diagram explanations](../specification/model-text.md), where many of them are referenced within their subject area.
