It utilizes resource flows connecting many agents (people, organizations, ecological agents). These resource flows can include value creation, usage, and/or transfer.</p> <p>As a flow-oriented model, Valueflows can coordinate whole networks as easily as one company, including regions and circular economies.  An economic network consists of independent economic agents collaborating to produce and distribute goods and services to meet human and ecological needs. For example, food, clothing, housing, education, health care. healthy soil, etc.</p> <p>At its core, Valueflows implements an ontology called REA (Resources Events Agents). REA is an accounting and business process modeling ontology, which was initially driven by the advent of computers and the concept of normalization of data models. As such it represents a simple and elegant model for planning and recording real-world economic activity, as opposed to the conventional abstraction of debits/credits, although those can be derived. To REA we have added some concepts found in various economic groups (for example recipes, offers and requests), and ecological accounting (which is ignored in most accounting treatments), as well as made the ontology more implementation-ready and friendly to distributed protocols.</p> <p>For example, the Valueflows ontology is designed to support</p> <ul> <li>coordination of economic activity both inside and between organizations, an enterprise is not assumed;</li> <li>reciprocity with or without money, money is not assumed;</li> <li>ecological agents as part of the network; externalities documented as resource flows.</li> </ul> <p>On a more technical level, the main purpose of Valueflows is to facilitate interoperability among different software applications.  It specifies the vocabulary, but not the technical protocol.  The Valueflows core model has also been used to design new economic software applications, but that is not necessary for interoperability.</p> <p>Namespace</p> <p>The namespace for Valueflows terms is <code>https://w3id.org/valueflows/ont/vf#</code>.

This process determines which activities are \"critical\" (i.e., on the longest path) and which have \"total float\" (i.e., can be delayed without making the project longer). In project management, a critical path is the sequence of project network activities which add up to the longest overall duration, regardless if that longest duration has float or not. This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project. </p> <p>How to use CPM: prioritize all of the processes on the critical path. Delaying any of them will delay the whole project.

That is because one cannot tell when reports could have been published containing that data, and many financial reports cannot be amended.</p> <p>Valueflows allows for correction of an economic event with another economic event, which should be recorded with a <code>corrects</code> link to the original event.  This gives flexibility to display the event as corrected, or as separate events, depending on the need.  The quantity should be the amount to be added or subtracted from the original event quantity.  So this works differently than the increment/decrement rules, and will be the only time negative quantities can be used.  It is not required, but is often customary to completely \"back out\" or \"reverse\" the original record (i.e. if the quantity was 10, then the quantity of the correction record is -10, as of the date corrected); then the original event can be re-entered correctly with the earlier correct date and no need for the <code>corrects</code> link. Alternatively, the correction event could just record the difference, as of the date of correction, with the <code>corrects</code> link to the original.</p> <p>If the original event was input to or output of a process, or was part of an agreement, then the correction event should contain those same relationships so it will appear embedded into the flow(s) where it belongs without worrying about the <code>corrects</code> link.  The correction event should be recorded as of the date of the correction, though.</p> <p>All events should record the computer-generated <code>created</code> date/time also, as this may be used in periodic reports to keep the events filtered properly without missing or double counting anything; or where it is important to be able to compare traces (for example) to verify representation of the same resource based on history. (This is also needed when events are allowed to be recorded after the fact, irrespective of corrections, which is true for many situations.  That is, often the event date will be earlier than the created date.)</p>"},{"location":"concepts/actions/","title":"Actions","text":"<p>All flows (Economic Event, Commitment, Intent, Claim, Recipe Flow) use an action property to designate what the flow is doing and how it will affect or has affected an economic resource (or not).</p> <p>See also Flows and Economic Resources.</p> <p>The actions contain data that defines how they will behave relative to a user interface, and relative to the effects on economic resources.

If extended, we recommend that they be defined as part of this or another formal vocabulary so that all can use them and assume the same meaning.</p> <p>produce - A new resource is created in the process, or an addition to an existing stock resource of the same type is incremented.  <code>produce</code> is used in manufacturing of goods, but also in any kind of creation of a material or digital or energy resource.</p> <p>consume - Most often, an input ingredient or component is transformed  into the output(s) of the process. Or the input resource can be just used up during the process, like energy. After the process the specified quantity of the consumed input is gone.</p> <p>use - Most often <code>use</code> is employed for equipment or tools that are used in a process, but not consumed.  After the process, the piece of equipment of tool still exists, but during the process, it is unavailable. The unavailability can be useful to know if the resource must be scheduled, or if one needs to know how much the resource is used.</p> <p>cite - <code>cite</code> is used when a resource is input to a process, but is neither used nor consumed, and remains available during the process.  Examples are a design file or a scientific paper, any documented knowledge, which is cited so that the agent(s) responsible for the resource receive credit.</p> <p>work - <code>work</code> refers to labor applied to a process.  There is generally no identifiable resource involved, only the provider agent. In this case, the type of work or skill involved can be identified by a resource specification. A possible exception would be if the agent's work schedule is kept on a calendar, representing when the specific agent is available to work.</p> <p>pickup -  The transported resource or person enters the process; the same resource will appear later in an output of the process.</p> <p>dropoff -  The transported resource or person leaves the process; the same resource or person appeared in an input of this process.</p> <p>accept - This is used as input to a process involving repair, modification, testing, or similar of a resource.  The same resource will appear in the output of the process.  It is sometimes a bit of a gray area when to use <code>accept</code>/<code>modify</code> vs. <code>consume</code>/<code>produce</code>.  The choice is based on the need to have the same identified resource before and after the process. Generally if the resource is involved in a series of processes to create it before anything else happens to it, <code>accept</code>/<code>modify</code> is appropriate.  If the input resource and the output resource need to be identified as different resource specifications for any reason, then <code>accept</code>/<code>modify</code> is not appropriate.</p> <p>modify - The identified resource that was accepted into a process appears in the output of that process, with modifications made.  Note not all modifications require a physical change, for example quality testing.  In all cases though, it matters that the resource has gone through that process, and the <code>stage</code> of the resource (the process specification of the process) is then used as part of the logical identification of the resource when the resource is requested as a process input or for a transfer.</p> <p>combine - A resource is put in a package or a combination resource; the same resource might appear later when it is separated.  Examples are packing one or more resources for transportation or storage, creation of a kit resource, a herd of cows.  The combined resource is still identified in the system, but is <code>containedIn</code> the package or combination resource, which would be usually produced in the process.  When a resource is <code>containedIn</code> another resource, it could be still available, depending on the use case.  Note that packing materials or containers which will continue to have their own identity later are also combined in the process; if not, they can be consumed.</p> <p>separate - A resource is removed from a package or a combination resource; the same resource appeared as input earlier in another process when it was combined.  When the resource is separated, it loses its <code>containedIn</code> reference.</p> <p>deliverService - A new service is produced and delivered as output of a process. A service implies that an agent actively receives the service at the same time as it is delivered.  Services are not tangible, so would not create or increment an inventoried resource. Services are perhaps most often delivered directly to an agent. But unlike other actions, sometimes the service is at the same time being delivered into another documented process, in which case it can be output from a process and input to another, at the same time.</p> <p>transferAllRights - This action gives full (in the human realm) rights and responsibilities to another agent, without transferring physical custody.  People might call this \"ownership\"; or it might be considered \"stewardship\" or similar.  This occurs instantaneously, and does not involve documented physical transfer.</p> <p>transferCustody - This action gives physical custody and control of a resource to another agent, without involving rights. The physical custodian often has responsibilities associated with custody, however.  Examples where transfer of custody is useful are loaning a resource to another agent, or when a resource is transferred to have a service performed by another agent, like transportation or repair.</p> <p>transfer - This action gives full (human) rights and responsibilities plus physical custody, combining the last two actions for simplicity.</p> <p>move - <code>move</code> changes the location (and possibly the identifier, if location is part of the logical identifier) of a resource, but does not transfer agent rights or custodianship.</p> <p>copy - A new resource is created for the receiver, an exact copy of the original provider resource, used for digital resources.</p> <p>raise - This action adjusts a quantity up, used either when a computer system is brought up and existing resources must be entered with a beginning balance, or when an inventory count in the real world shows that the quantity in the computer system is too low.  When it is known how a resource was obtained, it is preferable to use the real action.</p> <p>lower - This action adjusts a quantity down, used either when a computer system is brought up and existing resources must be entered with a negative beginning balance (very rare!), or when an inventory count in the real world shows that the quantity in the computer system is too high.  When it is known how a resource was lowered, it is preferable to use the real action.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/actions/#action-behaviors","title":"Action Behaviors","text":"<p>The behaviors that are included on the tables below are also defined as Action properties so that computer systems can be \"data driven\" in this respect if desired.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/actions/#event-effects","title":"Event Effects","text":"<p>eventQuantity - Either only <code>resourceQuantity</code> or only <code>effortQuantity</code> or both make sense on an economic event with this action.

For example a resource could be 100 widgets on a pallet, lot number 1234.  If 10 of those widgets are consumed in a process that makes something out of them, that is an event: consumption of 10 widgets of lot number 1234.  The 10 widgets are not considered a resource in their own right, and especially not an EconomicResource.  Rather the event triggers the decrement of the original resource of 100 widgets, which now has quantity of 90.</p> <p>For serialized or uniquely identified resources, if the logical and technical unique identifiers are not changed by an event, such as moving a vehicle to another location without any changes to its accountable agent (and assuming location is not part of the logical identifier), the resource does not behave like a stock and is not decremented or incremented.</p> <p>All economic information in an Economic Resource must be initially put there by an Economic Event.

The most important one is removal of non-operational and pre-operational features, centered around Scenario. We also removed the agent relationship model, which can be considered out of scope of the core economic model for now. All documentation of any feature removed is in the git issues, labeled <code>Removed 1.0</code>.  These features will continue to be worked on, in collaboration with user groups implementing them, and will be targeted for future releases.</p> <p>This vocabulary is based on decades of work in academia and several implementations in the field.  The core model being published is considered stable.  However, there are also many known and unknown edge cases and possibly not-so-edge cases where the model will need to be enhanced for the reality in the field. Also, this model represents something new, something that we want to be able to support the next economy, with all the unknowns that will bring.</p> <p>So we see continuous improvements happening as the vocabulary is adopted by more people, through ongoing collaboration between the VF team and the adopters.
