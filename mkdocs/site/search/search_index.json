This process determines which activities are \"critical\" (i.e., on the longest path) and which have \"total float\" (i.e., can be delayed without making the project longer). In project management, a critical path is the sequence of project network activities which add up to the longest overall duration, regardless if that longest duration has float or not.

That is because one cannot tell when reports could have been published containing that data, and many financial reports cannot be amended.</p> <p>Valueflows allows for correction of an economic event with another economic event, which should be recorded with a <code>corrects</code> link to the original event.  This gives flexibility to display the event as corrected, or as separate events, depending on the need.  The quantity should be the amount to be added or subtracted from the original event quantity.  So this works differently than the increment/decrement rules, and will be the only time negative quantities can be used.  It is not required, but is often customary to completely \"back out\" or \"reverse\" the original record (i.e. if the quantity was 10, then the quantity of the correction record is -10, as of the date corrected); then the original event can be re-entered correctly with the earlier correct date and no need for the <code>corrects</code> link. Alternatively, the correction event could just record the difference, as of the date of correction, with the <code>corrects</code> link to the original.</p> <p>If the original event was input to or output of a process, or was part of an agreement, then the correction event should contain those same relationships so it will appear embedded into the flow(s) where it belongs without worrying about the <code>corrects</code> link.

After the process, the piece of equipment of tool still exists, but during the process, it is unavailable. The unavailability can be useful to know if the resource must be scheduled, or if one needs to know how much the resource is used.</p> <p>consume - Most often, an ingredient or component is transformed  into the output(s) of the process. Or the input resource can be used up during the process, like energy. After the process the specified quantity of the consumed input is gone.</p> <p>cite - <code>cite</code> is used when a resource is input to a process, but is neither used nor consumed, and remains available during the process.  Examples are a design file or a scientific paper, any digital knowledge, which is cited so that the agent(s) responsible for the resource receive credit.</p> <p>work - <code>work</code> refers to labor power applied to a process.  There is generally no identifiable resource involved, only the provider agent. In this case, the type of work or skill involved can be identified by a resource specification. A possible exception would be if the agent's work schedule is kept on a calendar, representing when the specific agent is available to work.</p> <p>pickup -  The transported resource or person enters the process; the same resource will appear later in an output of the process.  It is assumed that the resource is already in custody of the agent providing the transportation.</p> <p>dropoff -  The transported resource or person leaves the process; the same resource or person appeared in an input of this process.</p> <p>accept - This is used as input to a process involving repair, modification, testing, or similar of a resource.  The same resource will appear in the output of the process.  It is sometimes a bit of a gray area when to use <code>accept</code>/<code>modify</code> vs. <code>consume</code>/<code>produce</code>.  The choice is based on the need to have the same identified resource before and after the process. Generally if the resource is involved in a series of processes to create it before anything else happens to it, <code>accept</code>/<code>modify</code> is appropriate.  If the input resource and the output resource need to be identified as different resource specifications for any reason, then <code>accept</code>/<code>modify</code> is not appropriate.</p> <p>modify - The identified resource that was accepted into a process appears in the output of that process, with modifications made.  Note not all modifications require a physical change, for example quality testing.  In all cases though, it matters that the resource has gone through that process, and the <code>stage</code> of the resource (the process specification of the process) is then used as part of the logical identification of the resource when the resource is requested as a process input or for a transfer.</p> <p>combine - A resource is put in a package or a combination resource; the same resource might appear later when it is separated.  Examples are packing one or more resources for transportation or storage, or creation of a kit resource.  The combined resource is still identified in the system, but is <code>containedIn</code> the package or combination resource, which would be usually produced in the process.  When a resource is <code>containedIn</code> another resource, it is not available on its own.  Note that packing materials or containers which will continue to have their own identity later are also combined in the process; if not, they can be consumed.</p> <p>separate - A resource is removed from a package or a combination resource; the same resource appeared as input earlier in this or another process when it was combined.  When the resource is separated, it loses its <code>containedIn</code> reference, and becomes available on its own.</p> <p>deliverService - A new service is produced and delivered as output of a process. A service implies that an agent actively receives the service at the same time as it is delivered.  Services are not tangible, so would not create or increment an inventoried resource. Services are perhaps most often delivered directly to an agent. But unlike other actions, sometimes the service is at the same time being delivered into another documented process, in which case it can be output from a process and input to another, at the same time. </p> <p>transferAllRights - This action gives full (in the human realm) rights and responsibilities to another agent, without transferring physical custody.  People might call this \"ownership\"; or it might be considered \"stewardship\" or similar.  This occurs instantaneously, and does not involve documented physical transfer.  It is often <code>triggeredBy</code> a transfer of custody, for example shipping or receipt of goods.</p> <p>transferCustody - This action gives physical custody and control of a resource to another agent, without full rights. The physical custodian often has responsibilities associated with custody, however.  Examples where transfer of custody is useful are loaning a resource to another agent, or when a resource is transferred to have a service performed by another agent, like transportation or repair.</p> <p>transfer - This action gives full (human) rights and responsibilities plus physical custody, combining the last two actions.</p> <p>move - <code>move</code> changes the location (and possibly the identifier, if location is part of the logical identifier) of a resource, but does not transfer agent rights or custodianship.</p> <p>copy - A new resource is created for the receiver, an exact copy of the original provider resource.</p> <p>raise - This action adjusts a quantity up, used either when a computer system is brought up and existing resources must be entered with a beginning balance, or when an inventory count in the real world shows that the quantity in the computer system is too low.  When it is known how a resource was obtained, it is preferable to use the real action.</p> <p>lower - This action adjusts a quantity down, used either when a computer system is brought up and existing resources must be entered with a negative beginning balance (very rare!), or when an inventory count in the real world showing that the quantity in the computer system is too high.

We are calling those Scenarios.</p> <p>Processes can be composed into scenarios at any level.  Like scheduled plans, these scenarios can be created from recipes.  Like scheduled plans, they have inputs and outputs (usually intents, sometimes sumarized economic events), derived from nested processes.</p> <p>Some examples we have seen:</p> <ul> <li>Plan Refinement. Before the final operation plan is set, sometimes it is useful to make more general plans, which then can be refined further, ending with the scheduled plan.  These plans are estimates made using \"planning horizons\", which are defined durations starting from the planning date - for example year then month, then blending into the actual scheduled plans.</li> <li>Budgeting.  A Budget is a summary of input requirements for a scope for a time interval (sometimes corresponding to the organization's \"accounting period\"), often yearly, as a higher level of planning. Budgets are often created to support a specific goal. Budgets are usually created before operational planning is done, and are estimates.  Often a forecast is made consisting of desired or expected deliverables for the period, sometimes using past event history as a starting point.  This would create a demand-driven budget.  Or sometimes a supply-driven budget makes more sense, for example when all of the producing capacity will be used in any case, and then the outputs will be constrained by the inputs available.  In any case, the budgeted inputs and outputs are kept, as they are often compared to actuals later.  The budget itself could be represented as a Process, and it could nest line item processes based on type of resource or process.  A budget is usually for one scope.</li> <li>Comparative Analysis.  Often different plans will be created for the same basic data set.  One example is when doing risk analysis or other comparative analysis.  Different assumptions might skew a plan in different useful directions, for example a \"normal scenario\" and a \"worst case scenario\".</li> <li>Network Analysis.  This is an analytical look at all or some of the actual and/or potential resource flows for a scope, often a community or region.

One use of this kind of analysis is to identify gaps and opportunities to keep resources circulating in a community to improve economic health and resilience.</li> </ul> <p>Agents can define different scenarios that they want to use. So for example, if a group does yearly budgets, each budget for different years could reference the same \"yearly budget\" scenario definition.</p> <p>The model itself is quite flexible, and we expect there will be more uses for it, all using the basic input-process-output structure with resource flows connecting them, contained by a scenario.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/estimates/#connecting-plans-and-scenarios","title":"Connecting Plans and Scenarios","text":"<p>Plans do not need to be directly connected to Scenarios, although they can be.

For example, the plan for carrots could be aggregated into the higher level plan for all vegetables.</p> <p>Often Plans do not fit cleanly within Scenarios, because plans tend to be for real production when it happens, which usually does not fit nicely into accounting periods or planning horizons.

We want to allow each scope or context to define resources that they have relationships with, according to the combination of properties that works best for them, which might include which agent has which relationship with a resource.</p> <p>And then in the \"independent view\", for larger-scale analysis of resource flows, or for example for lot tracking for public health issues like mad cow disease, different combinations of properties might be needed.</p> <p>Substitutability: This defines if any resources of that specification can be freely substituted for any other resource of that same specification when used, consumed, traded, etc.  For example, one container of \"B9R-1-red DLP resin photopolymer\" is probably substitutable for another container of the same photopolymer.  While each resource for a resource specification called \"English-Spanish translation\" is probably not substitutable because each will be a different document.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#unique-identifiers-for-resources","title":"Unique identifiers for resources","text":"<p>This can vary.  And people can be allowed within some boundaries of agreement to specify which combination of other properties would constitute identifiers.</p> <p>Here are some examples from manufacturing situations:</p> <ul> <li>Unique identifier = an assigned serialized identifier, which is unique across manufacturers, due to agreements in an industry.  Examples are computers, vehicles, and other equipment.</li> <li>Unique identifier = resource model + lot identifier + location + owner: so in other words, the owner of the rights was part of the unique identifier of the resource, and if the resource got transferred from one owner to another, the first owner's resources would be decremented, and the second owner's resources would be incremented.</li> </ul> <p>Note in the last case, a transfer of rights means a different resource. This is common with resources that are not serialized, where one logical resource has a quantity greater than 1, and the individual instances are substitutable.

For example, in creating a translation, you might have one translated document pass through translation, editing, proofreading, and formatting stages. You don't want to bring that resource into the formatting stage until it has been proofread, for example. Or you might have a testing stage for a component or product, in which case you don't want to consume or transfer the resource until it both has been through the testing stage, and had a <code>pass</code> output state.</p> <p>These can be defined on the recipe or the plan, showing where an input flow expects a certain stage and/or state of a resource. In that case, Dependent demand planning will select only those resources that fit the specified stage and state.  In user-interface forms for adding EconomicEvents, the input event form should query EconomicResources for required stage and state when offering selections of possible input resources.

An event is also defined by its behavior in relation to the resource  (consume, use, produce, transfer, etc.).</p> <p>Some people use the terms \"stock\" and \"stock flow\".  A stock is a resource; a stock flow is an event. (The term stock is too limiting, since a resource could be digital, like a document or media file.)</p> <p>An event can trigger incrementing or decrementing a resource.  Sometimes it does neither, as in the case of using a piece of equipment or citing a document.  But in any case, the quantity of a resource related to the event is not a resource itself, it is just a property of the event.  For example a resource could be 100 widgets on a pallet, lot number 1234.  If 10 of those widgets are consumed in a process that makes something out of them, that is an event: consumption of 10 widgets of lot number 1234.  The 10 widgets are not a resource in their own right.  The event triggers the decrement of the original resource of 100 widgets, which now has quantity of 90.</p> <p>For serialized or uniquely identified resources, if the logical and technical unique identifiers are not changed by an event, such as moving a vehicle to another location without any changes to its accountable agent (and assuming location is not part of the logical identifier), the resource does not behave like a stock and is not decremented or incremented.</p> <p>All economic information in an Economic Resource must be put there by an Economic Event.  Non-economic information (note, image, etc.) can be updated on the Economic Resource directly. Economic information is anything that might affect periodic accounting or financial reporting.  In this way, there is always an immutable detailed time-based record of information that affected such reporting.  And there are not excessive (non-economic) events for only non-economic updates.</p> <p>Note that the economic information is therefore derived information, and could be re-calculated as needed by iterating through the Economic Events.

The concept of \"ownership\" may transition more into \"stewardship\" in a concept of the world that does not put humans in a position of controlling the world's resources or abdicating responsibilities to the ecosystem in the name of ownership.

The agent who checks it out can read it and is responsible for caring for it and returning it on time, another transfer of custody.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or let's say that a community has farmland and equipment held in common.  The community transfers responsibility for the land and equipment to some farmers to use and take care of.  The community also transfers seeds every year to the farmers, enough to grow the food the community needs.

This also may depend on the technology used.  So one network may have separate namespaces for the nodes in the network; another may have one namespace for the whole network.

They say what is happening to economic resources, and what economic agents are involved along the way.  They create the \"value flows\".</p> <p>A key concept in REA is Duality, which means that each event wants one or more balancing events: in other words, some kind of reciprocity.  REA uses an abstract word for this relationship in order to make the meaning configurable. The reciprocity does not need to happen at the same time, or in the same transaction.

At the same time, derived from the independent view, REA and Valueflows support each agent's own accounting view.</p> <p>For example, from one agent's viewpoint, the exchange may be a \"purchase\", from the other agent's viewpoint, it might be a \"sale\". From the neutral viewpoint, it is an exchange of resources, with usually at least two flows of resources, from different directions.</p> <p>For the individual agent\u2019s accounting systems, assuming an Exchange of goods for money, when the goods are transferred from the seller to the purchaser, the purchaser\u2019s Accounts Payable are increased (credited) and the seller\u2019s Accounts Receivable are increased (debited).

Or maybe it would be better to say \"in any direction\", but forwards means in the direction of value creation, and backwards means in the direction of return or compensation.</li> <li>Corollary: the model must be able to support various fair methods of distribution of resources.  The ability to find contributions to the network or the economy regardless of where and when in the network configuration those contributions occurred is key.</li> <li>The model must also be able to support coordinating work between different people in different organizations. People who are not concerned with rewards may still want to coordinate work.</li> <li>The model must be able to support circular economies, value flows where resources come full cycle to be fed into the same set or other processes.  Recycling, re-use, and other ways to encourage resources not becoming waste, must be supported.  Flows currently considered \"externalities\" should be able to be internalized in the model.</li> <li>The model must be fractal. It must support global views of networks in aggregate as well as drilling down to lower and lower levels of detail. Those lower levels of detail, for example inside one organization, may require permissions.</li> <li>The model must also work on the Knowledge, Plan and Observation levels, where the objects on each level are linked appropriately to the other levels.</li> <li>The model must support non-business-as-usual organizational forms and economic relationships in addition to traditional business organizations and relationships. These organizational forms can be as varied as the people and groups who create them want. VF in particular embraces this experimentation towards next-economy / solidarity-economy / commons-based-economy / P2P-economy/etc. in this transitional time.</li> <li>The model must support systems where all the people involved can get shares of the outcome to allocate as they wish. The shared outcome could be resources produced by the contributors, like food, or it could be income (reciprocal resources exchanged for resources produced). A group can choose to introduce various monetary currencies into their flows but can also do all the coordination and accounting without introducing such artifacts.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"introduction/status/","title":"Status of the vocabulary","text":"<p>This documentation is for release 0.6. Change log can be found here.</p> <p>[Temporary note as of 2023/Jan/28: Most of the content for v0.7 has been added, for purposes of easier review.  But there may be further changes.  The new release is not tagged and not official.  That should happen within a few days.]</p> <p>This vocabulary is based on decades of work in academia and some limited work in the field in software implementations - and further development by the VF team through documenting and studying use cases.  The stability of the model reflects this history.  The core model is fairly stable, more so in structure, somewhat less in naming.  However, there are many edge cases and possibly not-so-edge cases where the model will need to be adjusted for the reality in the field based on further experience. Also, this model represents something new, something that we want to be able to support the next economy, with all the unknowns that will bring. </p> <p>So we see continuous improvements happening as the vocabulary is adopted by more people, through ongoing collaboration between the VF team and the adopters.</p> <p>The core model adapted from academic work on REA includes:</p> <ul> <li>Resources, Events, Agents (REA)</li> <li>Commitments</li> <li>the classifications/specifications in the knowledge layer</li> </ul> <p>Other relatively consolidated parts of the vocabulary include: </p> <ul> <li>Agent model</li> <li>Core Input-Process-Output model</li> <li>Core Recipe model</li> </ul> <p>Less stable are: </p> <ul> <li>Intents and Proposals</li> <li>Budgeting and Analysis</li> <li>Claims</li> </ul> <p>Coming in future releases are:</p> <ul> <li>Forking/versioning of Recipes</li> <li>Conversations for Action</li> <li>Quantitative and qualitative measurements, with SOSA</li> <li>One or more extensions for value calculation, distribution algorithms</li> </ul>"},{"location":"specification/external-terms/","title":"External namespaces and terms","text":"<p>Most applications using VF will need terms defined in various other vocabularies.

This file includes units from OM2 as of 2022/06. It includes only the English version for now.

We have added classifications (partially complete) to facilitate search for needed units. The columns in this file are, left to right:</p> <ul> <li>OM2 owl Class.  When a Unit belonged to multiple classes, those were consolidated to one row, under \"Unit\".</li> <li>Identifier in OM2.  These can be prefixed with \"http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/\" for direct access.</li> <li>Label from OM2 for the unit, to be used in Valueflows.</li> <li>Symbol from OM2 for the unit, to be used in Valueflows.</li> <li>Description from OM2.</li> <li>Classification(s), added by us (not from OM), to facilitate search in the csv file, or ifn an application (if one is created) for groups to choose their units.

This indicates a generic one dimensional unit from the scientific perspective, which in business is often called \"each\", \"pieces\", \"count\", or similar.
