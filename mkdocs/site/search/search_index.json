See Graph search algorithms . This description refers to this diagram: Take each request for quantities of Recipe Resource as a demand and start the traversal. Start: First check for onhand and available Economic Resources, or previously scheduled output Intents, that are not yet allocated to any demand. Allocate any that you find to the highest priority demand (where highest priority usually means earliest delivery date). (Those are soft allocations, known only in the computer system.) For demands that find no or insufficient available inventory or output Intents, look for a Recipe Process that can create some. If you can't find a Recipe Process, suggest a purchase.

When you \"trace\" a cellphone call, you try to determine its origin... You go backward to the starting point. To track: follow the emerging path forwards from your starting point to wherever the thing currently is... When you \"track\" a cellphone, you monitor [the starting] location ... and follow it wherever it goes... One of the most-often used traces is to find the origins of health problems like mad cow disease and tainted drugs and food. In Valueflows terms, that would start with the product (economic resource) that caused a health problem, and trace back along the chain of resource flows to the source or sources of the product. Then it might be necessary to also track forwards from the source(s) to find everything else that might include that source(s). It is also used when the provenance is useful for other information, like to determine the sustainability of the creation of a resource (like fossil fuel inputs, potential carbon implications, etc.), how healthy the inputs are, how local is the production and distribution, etc. Or when an agent is interested in what happens to a resource they created, for example what is the effect of their recycling efforts or material donations to an educational program. Also, this logic is used in other features, like \"contribution economy\" calculations, where all contributions of various kinds over time can be found be tracing backwards from an end resource. Valueflows query terminology previous and next bring back the element one flow step backwards or forwards track and trace bring back the whole resource flow tree forwards or backwards, starting with a resource or an output event Briefly, to gather a whole track or trace, the previous or next methods should be used in recursive logic, traveling down the flow and each branch of the flow, when there are many inputs or many outputs. Trace logic Adding breadcrumbs on initial save For the most part, the structure provides the causal order of the flows. But for some specific situations, such as repeated cycles referencing the same ProcessSpecifications, additional information should be saved on the EconomicEvent and EconomicResource to aid in obtaining consistent causal order. (Timestamps are not reliable in distributed systems.) Add two new fields called previousEvent , one on EconomicResource and one on EconomicEvent. The previousEvent fields reference an EconomicEvent. When a new event is created with a resourceInventoriedAs , the new event takes the resource's previousEvent value and puts it into the new event's previousEvent field, and puts the new event into the resource's previousEvent field. Those previousEvent references provide breadcrumbs for tracking and tracing through ambiguous situations, see pseudocode below. Where to start a trace The \"starting item\" can be an EconomicResource or EconomicEvent. If you want to start at the present time, and trace everything that ever happened to the resource, start with the resource and the value of its previousEvent . If you just want to know how a resource was made, and what inputs went into it, start with selecting the output event where that resource was initially created, or if it is a stock resource, where it was last incremented. Pseudocode The following is included to give some idea of the logic required. It tries to cover all actions and scenarios, but is meant as a suggestion, and has not been thoroughly tested in code. EconomicResource \"previous\": find all events that are process outputs and where the resource is resourceInventoriedAs find all events that have the resource as toResourceInventoriedAs (all transfers and move) find all raise/lower events that reference the resource as resourceInventoriedAs return all of the above events Process \"previous\": return all events that are input to the process EconomicEvent \"previous\": if the event is output of a process return the process else if the event is triggeredBy another event return the triggeredBy event else if resourceInventoriedAs of the event exists return the resourceInventoriedAs trace (parameter: starting item) initialize \"flows\", \"visited\", \"contained\", \"modified\", \"delivered\" (list or similar, \"flows\" must be ordered) add the starting item to \"visited\" add the starting item to \"flows\" if the item is an unpack event add the resourceInventoriedAs to \"contained\" if the item is a modify event add the resourceInventoriedAs to \"modified\" if the item is a dropoff event add the resourceInventoriedAs to \"delivered\" call trace-depth-first-search (which will go recursively backwards through the tree) return \"flows\" trace-depth-first-search (parameters: \"flows\", \"visited\", \"contained\", \"modified\", \"delivered\", \"savedEvent\") for the last item in \"flows\", get \"previous\" (defined below) if that last item is an event save the previousEvent in savedEvent order descending the \"previous\" items by id or other unique element if the savedEvent is one of those items move it to the position where it will be processed first for each of those items if the item is not in \"visited\" set \"skip\" to false if the item is a pickup event if the event's resourceInventoriedAs is in \"delivered\" remove it from \"delivered\" else set \"skip\" to true else if the item is an accept event if the event's resourceInventoriedAs is in \"modified\" remove it from \"modified\" else set \"skip\" to true else if the item is a pack event if the event's resourceInventoriedAs is in \"contained\" remove it from \"contained\" else set \"skip\" to true else if the item is an unpack event add the resourceInventoriedAs to \"contained\" else if the item is a modify event add the resourceInventoriedAs to \"modified\" else if the item is a dropoff event add the resourceInventoriedAs to \"delivered\" if \"skip\" is false add the item to \"visited\" add the item to \"flows\" call trace-depth-first-search return \"flows\" Track logic Pseudocode Again, the following is included to give some idea of the logic required. It tries to cover all actions and scenarios, but is meant as a suggested starting point, it has not been tested in code. EconomicResource \"next\": return all events where the resource is resourceInventoriedAs Process \"next\": return all events that are output of the process EconomicEvent \"next\": if the event is input of a process return the process if there are any events that are triggeredBy this event return them if the event is output of a process return the resourceInventoriedAs if the toResourceInventoriedAs of the event exists return the toResourceInventoriedAs track (parameter: starting item) TBD.... return \"flows\" Tracking identifier and lot Currently, often companies' internal flow information is not public, although in many countries they are required to be able to provide input and output information when needed in a medical emergency, without connecting all the dots internally. Also any organization can be missing resource flow data so that there are gaps in the flows, no matter the level of transparency. For these reasons, tracking identifier (often a serial number) and a standard lot identifier are currently used when food or medical tracing and tracking is required. And in VF, they can be used whenever there is missing resource flow information for any reason; or when many resources go in and out of one process, such as might happen in transportation. Note that in VF, for simplicity, besides lot , a lot identifier can be stored in the trackingIdentifier property. Also note that lots get \"spread out\" into splits of a resource or different types of resources. For example, one cow could have a lot identifier, which when the cow goes through a butchering process will be included in all the cuts of beef from that cow. Or one production batch of a medicine that contains many packages of the same medicine would have a lot identifier, which stays attached to the individual packages wherever they go.","title":"Track and Trace"},{"location":"algorithms/track/#difference-between-tracking-and-tracing","text":"From StackExchange: : The difference is in direction & point in time: To trace: follow the completed path backwards from its current point to where it began...

Also any organization can be missing resource flow data so that there are gaps in the flows, no matter the level of transparency. For these reasons, tracking identifier (often a serial number) and a standard lot identifier are currently used when food or medical tracing and tracking is required. And in VF, they can be used whenever there is missing resource flow information for any reason; or when many resources go in and out of one process, such as might happen in transportation. Note that in VF, for simplicity, besides lot , a lot identifier can be stored in the trackingIdentifier property. Also note that lots get \"spread out\" into splits of a resource or different types of resources. For example, one cow could have a lot identifier, which when the cow goes through a butchering process will be included in all the cuts of beef from that cow. Or one production batch of a medicine that contains many packages of the same medicine would have a lot identifier, which stays attached to the individual packages wherever they go.","title":"Tracking identifier and lot"},{"location":"appendix/presentations/","text":"Other Available Documentation We are occasionally asked for other documentation and visuals for Valueflows.

Actions are defined as follows. vf:produce - A new resource is created in that process or an addition to an existing stock resource of the same type is incremented. produce is used in manufacturing of goods, but also in any kind of creation of a material or digital or energy resource. vf:use - Most often use is employed for equipment or tools that are used in a process, but not consumed. After the process, the piece of equipment of tool still exists, but during the process, it is unavailable. This can be useful to know if the resource must be scheduled, or if one needs to know how much the resource is used. vf:consume - Most often, an ingredient or component is transformed into the output(s) of the process. Or the input resource can be used up during the process, like energy. After the process the specified quantity of the consumed input is gone. vf:cite - cite is used when a resource is input to a process, but is neither used nor consumed, and remains available during the process. Examples are a design file or a scientific paper, any digital knowledge, which is cited so that the agent(s) responsible for the resource receive credit. vf:work - work refers to labor power applied to a process. There is generally no identifiable resource involved, only the provider agent. In this case, the type of work or skill involved can be identified by a resource specification. A possible exception would be if the agent's work schedule is kept on a calendar, representing when the specific agent is available to work. vf:pickup - The transported resource or person enters the process; the same resource will appear later in an output of the process. It is assumed that the resource is already in custody of the agent providing the transportation. vf:dropoff - The transported resource or person leaves the process; the same resource or person appeared in an input of this process. vf:accept - This is used as input to a process involving repair, modification, testing, or similar of a resource. The same resource will appear in the output of the process. It is sometimes a bit of a gray area when to use accept / modify vs. consume / produce . The choice is based on the need to have the same identified resource before and after the process. Generally if the resource is involved in a series of processes to create it before anything else happens to it, accept / modify is appropriate. If the input resource and the output resource need to be identified as different resource specifications for any reason, then accept / modify is not appropriate. vf:modify - The identified resource that was accepted into a process appears in the output of that process, with modifications made. Note not all modifications require a physical change, for example quality testing. In all cases though, it matters that the resource has gone through that process, and the stage of the resource (the process specification of the process) is then used as part of the logical identification of the resource when the resource is requested as a process input or for a transfer. vf:combine - A resource is put in a package or a combination resource; the same resource might appear later when it is separated. Examples are packing one or more resources for transportation or storage, or creation of a kit resource. The combined resource is still identified in the system, but is containedIn the package or combination resource, which would be usually produced in the process. When a resource is containedIn another resource, it is not available on its own. Note that packing materials or containers which will continue to have their own identity later are also combined in the process; if not, they can be consumed. vf:separate - A resource is removed from a package or a combination resource; the same resource appeared as input earlier in this or another process when it was combined. When the resource is separated, it loses its containedIn reference, and becomes available on its own. vf:deliver-service - A new service is produced and delivered as output of a process. A service implies that an agent actively receives the service at the same time as it is delivered. Services are not tangible, so would not create or increment an inventoried resource. Services are perhaps most often delivered directly to an agent. But unlike other actions, sometimes the service is at the same time being delivered into another documented process, in which case it can be output from a process and input to another, at the same time. vf:transfer-all-rights - This action gives full (in the human realm) rights and responsibilities to another agent, without transferring physical custody. People might call this \"ownership\"; or it might be considered \"stewardship\" or similar. This occurs instantaneously, and does not involve documented physical transfer. It is often triggeredBy a transfer of custody, for example shipping or receipt of goods. vf:transfer-custody - This action gives physical custody and control of a resource to another agent, without full rights. The physical custodian often has responsibilities associated with custody, however. Examples where transfer of custody is useful are loaning a resource to another agent, or when a resource is transferred to have a service performed by another agent, like transportation or repair. vf:transfer - This action gives full (human) rights and responsibilities plus physical custody, combining the last two actions. vf:move - move changes the location, and possibly the identifier, if location is part of the logical identifier, of a resource with no transfer of agent rights or custodianship. vf:raise - This action adjusts a quantity up, used either when a computer system is brought up and existing resources must be entered with a beginning balance, or when an inventory count in the real world shows that there the quantity in the computer system is too low. When it is known how a resource was obtained, it is preferable to use the real action. vf:lower - This action adjusts a quantity down, based on an inventory count in the real world showing that the quantity in the computer system is too high. When it is known how a resource was lowered, it is preferable to use the real action.

If extended, they should be defined as part of this or another formal vocabulary so that all can use them and assume the same meaning. However, the effects of the actions are included in the data definitions so that computer systems can be \"data driven\" in their effects on resources if desired. (1) The actions use and work are time-based actions, either with or without an explicit schedule. If the schedule is documented as part of the economic resource, then those economic events could decrement that schedule, although not the \"current quantity\" of the resource. (2) The transfer actions and move can optionally define a second identified resource on the receiver side. (3) The action deliver-service can sometimes be an input to another process, at the same time as it is an output from a process. This is because services imply delivery as they are created. (4) These actions should update the resource's currentLocation if toLocation is provided on the event. For dropoff it is the resource which is affected by the event, for all others it is the to resource, the resource that results from the event. For the latter, the resource and to resource may be the same resource, depending on how resources are identified in the user community. (5) These actions should update the resource's primaryAccountable agent using the event's receiver agent. For produce , the resource is the one that is created by the event, if one is created. For the transfers, the resource updated is the toResourceInventoriedAs . For raise , this only applies if a new resource is created, not if an existing resource is raised.","title":"Actions"},{"location":"concepts/actions/#action-definitions","text":"All flows (Economic Event, Commitment, Intent, Claim, Recipe Flow) use an action property to designate what the flow is doing and how it will affect an economic resource (or not).

If the input resource and the output resource need to be identified as different resource specifications for any reason, then accept / modify is not appropriate. vf:modify - The identified resource that was accepted into a process appears in the output of that process, with modifications made. Note not all modifications require a physical change, for example quality testing. In all cases though, it matters that the resource has gone through that process, and the stage of the resource (the process specification of the process) is then used as part of the logical identification of the resource when the resource is requested as a process input or for a transfer. vf:combine - A resource is put in a package or a combination resource; the same resource might appear later when it is separated. Examples are packing one or more resources for transportation or storage, or creation of a kit resource. The combined resource is still identified in the system, but is containedIn the package or combination resource, which would be usually produced in the process. When a resource is containedIn another resource, it is not available on its own. Note that packing materials or containers which will continue to have their own identity later are also combined in the process; if not, they can be consumed. vf:separate - A resource is removed from a package or a combination resource; the same resource appeared as input earlier in this or another process when it was combined. When the resource is separated, it loses its containedIn reference, and becomes available on its own. vf:deliver-service - A new service is produced and delivered as output of a process. A service implies that an agent actively receives the service at the same time as it is delivered. Services are not tangible, so would not create or increment an inventoried resource. Services are perhaps most often delivered directly to an agent. But unlike other actions, sometimes the service is at the same time being delivered into another documented process, in which case it can be output from a process and input to another, at the same time. vf:transfer-all-rights - This action gives full (in the human realm) rights and responsibilities to another agent, without transferring physical custody. People might call this \"ownership\"; or it might be considered \"stewardship\" or similar. This occurs instantaneously, and does not involve documented physical transfer. It is often triggeredBy a transfer of custody, for example shipping or receipt of goods. vf:transfer-custody - This action gives physical custody and control of a resource to another agent, without full rights. The physical custodian often has responsibilities associated with custody, however. Examples where transfer of custody is useful are loaning a resource to another agent, or when a resource is transferred to have a service performed by another agent, like transportation or repair. vf:transfer - This action gives full (human) rights and responsibilities plus physical custody, combining the last two actions. vf:move - move changes the location, and possibly the identifier, if location is part of the logical identifier, of a resource with no transfer of agent rights or custodianship. vf:raise - This action adjusts a quantity up, used either when a computer system is brought up and existing resources must be entered with a beginning balance, or when an inventory count in the real world shows that there the quantity in the computer system is too low. When it is known how a resource was obtained, it is preferable to use the real action. vf:lower - This action adjusts a quantity down, based on an inventory count in the real world showing that the quantity in the computer system is too high. When it is known how a resource was lowered, it is preferable to use the real action.","title":"Action Definitions"},{"location":"concepts/actions/#action-behaviors","text":"Action Accounting effect Onhand effect I/O Other effect Pairs with produce Increment Increment Output primaryAccountable(5) N/A consume Decrement Decrement Input N/A N/A use No effect(1) No effect(1) Input N/A N/A work No effect(1) No effect(1) Input N/A N/A cite No effect No effect Input N/A N/A deliver-service No effect No effect Output(3) N/A N/A pickup No effect No effect Input N/A dropoff dropoff No effect No effect Output currentLocation(4) pickup accept No effect Decrement Input N/A modify modify No effect Increment Output N/A accept combine No effect Decrement Input add containedIn separate separate No effect Increment Output remove containedIn combine transfer-custody No effect Decr+Incr(2) N/A currentLocation(4) N/A transfer-all-rights Decr+Incr(2) No effect N/A primaryAccountable(5) N/A transfer Decr+Incr(2) Decr+Incr(2) N/A currentLocation(4), primaryAccountable(5) N/A move Decr+Incr(2) Decr+Incr(2) N/A currentLocation(4) N/A raise Increment Increment N/A primaryAccountable(5) N/A lower Decrement Decrement N/A N/A N/A We have defined a core set of actions, but expect that this will be extended with some others.

However, the effects of the actions are included in the data definitions so that computer systems can be \"data driven\" in their effects on resources if desired. (1) The actions use and work are time-based actions, either with or without an explicit schedule. If the schedule is documented as part of the economic resource, then those economic events could decrement that schedule, although not the \"current quantity\" of the resource. (2) The transfer actions and move can optionally define a second identified resource on the receiver side. (3) The action deliver-service can sometimes be an input to another process, at the same time as it is an output from a process. This is because services imply delivery as they are created. (4) These actions should update the resource's currentLocation if toLocation is provided on the event. For dropoff it is the resource which is affected by the event, for all others it is the to resource, the resource that results from the event. For the latter, the resource and to resource may be the same resource, depending on how resources are identified in the user community. (5) These actions should update the resource's primaryAccountable agent using the event's receiver agent. For produce , the resource is the one that is created by the event, if one is created. For the transfers, the resource updated is the toResourceInventoriedAs .

Agents Agents can be individual persons or organizations. Organizations include formal or informal organizations of all kinds. (The concept of \"Agent\" will in the future probably include \"ecological agents\", as we explore with others how to use REA for ecological accounting to combat climate change. The concept of \"Agent\" could also in the future include software agents, but this is controversial.) In Valueflows, we are talking about economic agents, agents who can create or exchange value, and make agreements with each other - who have economic agency. But we want to re-use existing vocabularies for commonly defined things (including foaf:Agent, foaf:Person, org:Organization), so we have elected to use those as much as possible here, even though they are sometimes more broadly defined. But also, the broader definitions will help map and integrate technologies across the web. If people want to define types of organizations (like cooperative, corporation, network, community, etc.) we provide a classification property which people can define as they wish. Agent Relationships Agent relationships have many nuances, thus VF provides the ability to define one's own kinds of relationships. For example people might \"participate\" with an organization by means of agreeing to terms and conditions. Or people might have more active \"membership\" in a group or organization. Or people might consider themselves members but want a more independently flavored term such as \"affiliates\". A relationship can be direct, like \"steward\", or more like a role, for example \"grower\" or \"harvester\" for a food network. Relationships can also include roles like \"sub-organization\" or \"trading partner\". There are a number of useful Properties in existing vocabularies that can be used. Or people can create their own as needed. Relationships have direction: For example, in \"Michael is a member of Enspiral\", Michael is the subject and Enspiral is the object. In this case the inverse is also valid, \"Enspiral has member Michael\". In VF, we consider this to be one relationship. One directional relationships like \"follows\" are also supported. Relationships can be in a scope (or not): For example, \"Kathy is mentor of Sam, in the scope of Enspiral.\" Agent Philosophies We also want to acknowledge that some people prefer to think of themselves as independent and decentralized agents who interact in different places in the economy as individuals, and some people think of themselves more as members of different groups and networks and communities and interact more in the context of those groups and networks and communities. Many experiments are going on as people strive towards another economy. We want to support all these experiments, so want to support both of these ways of thinking and organizing ourselves. The agent vocabulary is very flexible, and will support these as well as current conventional structures. So, if people want to form a group that has agency as a group, fine. If people want to consider that their group does not have agency as a group, also fine. Not all groups, and especially not all networks, will be economic Agents in Valueflows. That depends on the agreement of the people in the group, and what the group needs to do as-a-group. For example, does the group need to make agreements as-a-group with other groups?

The process of negotiation is directed at achieving an explicit, mutually understood, and agreed upon goal of a business collaboration and associated terms and conditions.

The Operational Planning section explains how to group those processes into a scheduled plan at an operational level. This section explains how to use the same process and plan pattern to represent higher level requirements, those that are not (yet) actually scheduled. We are calling those Scenarios. Processes can be composed into scenarios at any level. Like scheduled plans, these scenarios can be created from recipes. Like scheduled plans, they have inputs and outputs (usually intents, sometimes sumarized economic events), derived from nested processes. Some examples we have seen: Plan Refinement . Before the final operation plan is set, sometimes it is useful to make more general plans, which then can be refined further, ending with the scheduled plan. These plans are estimates made using \"planning horizons\", which are defined durations starting from the planning date - for example year then month, then blending into the actual scheduled plans. Budgeting . A Budget is a summary of input requirements for a scope for a time interval (sometimes corresponding to the organization's \"accounting period\"), often yearly, as a higher level of planning. Budgets are often created to support a specific goal. Budgets are usually created before operational planning is done, and are estimates. Often a forecast is made consisting of desired or expected deliverables for the period, sometimes using past event history as a starting point. This would create a demand-driven budget. Or sometimes a supply-driven budget makes more sense, for example when all of the producing capacity will be used in any case, and then the outputs will be constrained by the inputs available. In any case, the budgeted inputs and outputs are kept, as they are often compared to actuals later. The budget itself could be represented as a Process, and it could nest line item processes based on type of resource or process. A budget is usually for one scope. Comparative Analysis . Often different plans will be created for the same basic data set. One example is when doing risk analysis or other comparative analysis. Different assumptions might skew a plan in different useful directions, for example a \"normal scenario\" and a \"worst case scenario\". Network Analysis . This is an analytical look at all or some of the actual and/or potential resource flows for a scope, often a community or region. This can be modeled using higher level types of processes and types of resources, and could include intents or economic events. One use of this kind of analysis is to identify gaps and opportunities to keep resources circulating in a community to improve economic health and resilience. Agents can define different scenarios that they want to use. So for example, if a group does yearly budgets, each budget for different years could reference the same \"yearly budget\" scenario definition. The model itself is quite flexible, and we expect there will be more uses for it, all using the basic input-process-output structure with resource flows connecting them, contained by a scenario. Connecting Plans and Scenarios Plans do not need to be directly connected to Scenarios, although they can be. If comparisons are needed, often the time periods and scope are all that is needed. In addition, if resource specifications and/or process specifications are part of a classification taxonomy, that can be used for connecting the higher to lower perspectives. For example, the plan for carrots could be aggregated into the higher level plan for all vegetables. Often Plans do not fit cleanly within Scenarios, because plans tend to be for real production when it happens, which usually does not fit nicely into accounting periods or planning horizons. Seasonal food production can be an exception to this. Scenarios can be refinements of other scenarios. For example, a group might do scenarios for yearly estimates, then refine those for each month, before creating operational plans which will be executed.

For example, from one Agent's viewpoint, the exchange may be a Purchase, from the other Agent's viewpoint, it might be a Sale. From the neutral viewpoint, it is an exchange of resources, with usually at least two flows of resources, from different directions. So for example, the seller might give some goods to the buyer, and the buyer might give some money to the seller. Or in a barter exchange, one agent might give the other some books, and the other agent might compensate with some cookies. Exchange is ubiquitous on the internet today, with offers everywhere. In Valueflows, we track not only the offers and promises, but also the actual flows of resources in networks, in all directions. And we support exchanges that don't involve money as well as those that do. Valueflows enables multilateral exchange agreements as well. Any number of agents can commit to flows where they provide something and flows where they receive something. This way creating a reciprocal cycle in the flows graph. So for example, Alice can provide apples from her orchard to Bob, who can provide accommodation to Claire, who can provide tutoring to Alice's children. Such exchanges can happen in infinite number of possible ways, as long as all agents participating agree on specific reciprocal cycle in the flows graph. We also support non-reciprocal one-way transfers, such as in a gift economy. However, an exchange implies at least two transfers with reciprocity. Exchanges and flows Exchanges as modeled in VF actually relate to flows within agreements, not resources directly. Flows involved in transfers of rights and responsibilities are more obvious. Process related flows can also imply a transfer, and can thus be used as part of an exchange. For example, most timebanks exchange work for credits. The work event can be part of a process that produces something for some other agent. It is also part of an exchange in the timebank. The transfer of credits on the other hand, is not part of any process that creates or transports something, it is merely the timebank recording that one account was decremented and another account was incremented. Exchange of work also happens in open value networks, where people record work events as input to many processes, and then when income is received for outputs of that work, people receive part of that income, in exchange for their work. Another example is when a service is created as an output of a process, where that service delivery event can be considered an implied transfer, and exchanged for some other resource. Agreements Various kinds of agreements between agents often define the rights and responsibilities for economic resources that are transferred. Agreements can reflect any economic paradigm, so make it possible for the Exchange and Transfer vocabulary to work equally well for capitalist businesses, transitional economic interactions, and next economy interactions. Agreements can be of any kind and scope, from an order to a value equation to a larger blanket agreement.

On the process side, for example, planned work could be an Intent, but planned work that some agent committed to is a Commitment. Commitment Commitments describe potential future events which the involved agents have already agreed to pursue. Commitments can be considered contractual promises from one agent to another. Commitments can be thought of as plans for Economic Events, and Economic Events can fulfill Commitments. Commitments can satisfy Intents. Economic Event Economic Events describe past events, something observed, never some potential future event. They can fulfill Commitments or satisfy Intents (when there is no Commitment). Claim Claims resemble Commitments, but are initiated by the receiver, not the provider. An Economic Event can trigger a reciprocal Claim. Claims sometimes do not have to actually be saved, often they can be implied from an Economic Event and an Agreement. For example, if Alice has agreed to sell Bob some carrots for $2, then if Alice delivers the carrots to Bob, she has an implicit claim for $2 from Bob. Recipe Flow Recipes are used to create plans, and the Recipe Flow can create a corresponding Intent or a Commitment in a Plan, depending on if all the agents are known and the level of certainty of the planning. Timeline, plans and observations The figure below shows that Economic Events have to be observed and for that reason only appear as records of the past. Future plans get represented with Intents and Commitments. Matching Intents Often agents will start their plans independently and record their initial intents. Later once they make a Commitment with another agent, it will represent a specific shared part of their plans. For that reason any Commitment can result in Satisfaction of the providing agent's Intent as well as Satisfaction of the receiving agent's Intent. Granularity Intents, Commitments, and Economic Events can occur at any granularity that is needed or for which data can be obtained. So they primarily are used for all operational needs, but can also be used at higher levels for budgeting for organizations, analytical and high level planning needs for communities or regions, etc. Actions All types of flows use the same set of actions, which define what the flow does and how it behaves in relation to resources. You can find detailed documentation on actions in the next section . Quantities and Times Quantities are used for counting, such as: Exchange/transfer Resource increment and decrement Recipes, how much or many goes into and out of a transformation process Times are used for coordination and scheduling, such as: Calendar availability Planned timelines They can be used together for analysis and reporting, such as: Accounting totals (quantity) within accounting period (time) Quantities can be any needed unit of measure, including counts, volumes, weights, etc. Time can be a beginning/end time (an interval), or a point in time, or a due date. The flows require at least one of those. If a point in time is recorded, an application should return that time as the beginning and end time. Note that recipes may need to scale both quantities and calendar times when used to create a plan. Sometimes a quantity is expressed in time-based units, like \"I worked 6 hours\", or \"we used this machine for 8 hours\". These flows also will have a related time, like \"I worked from 10am to 4pm\", or \"we used this machine from 8am to 4pm\". In these examples, the quantity is used for accounting figures, exchange, recipes. The time is used to schedule and coordinate the work or machine usage. Sometimes a situation may call for a \"compound quantity\", like \"Number-per-Year\". Display note: The OM2 ontology defines a Unit called one that is used for one-dimensional units. This is confusing for many economic applications, where something like each would be used, or nothing at all. We recommend that user interfaces handle this by not displaying the unit one where it would be confusing, or substituting a more applicable name.","title":"Flows"},{"location":"concepts/flows/#kinds-of-flows","text":"Flows are a fundamental construct in the Valueflows ontology.

A plan normally contains one or more process resource flows, one for each deliverable. A plan can cover more than one scope , if the different scopes are tightly coordinated with pre-agreed rules, for example sub-organizations of a main organization, or an ongoing supply chain. If not, or if the agents prefer, then requirements from one scope could become deliverables for another scope's plan. Different batch sizes could trigger a new plan for inputs to the main deliverable too. But all of this does not affect the vocabulary or model. Plans can relate to each other through resource flows just like processes. Plans are used for understanding and coordinating what needs to happen for specific outputs. The size and complexity of a plan is up to the people who are planning and coordinating the work. A plan can be generated from a recipe , or created without one. Some examples: A communications group creates articles for a larger group. The communications group needs some of their articles to be translated into various languages, by another group within the larger group. Both the creation of an article and its translation could be part of the same plan. An organization decides to mount a campaign for some objective. There might be many different deliverables: a fundraising website, some brochures, some events, etc. All of these can be part of the same plan for easier coordination. For example, a campaign logo could be used in all of these separate outputs. An organization gets an order for some things they produce. They can create a plan to produce to that order, including all line items. Or they can gather all the orders for a time period for an item and produce to that as a larger plan. An organization produces a standard batch size to stock, in anticipation of future orders. Processes nested in a Plan When processes are \"nested\", it is not random, nor based on a taxonomy. It is based on what processes are actually part of the plan. And not all the inputs and outputs of nested processes are considered inputs and outputs of the plan, since some are both produced and consumed within the plan. In the following simplified example, the flows between plant/weed and weed/harvest start and end inside the nest, and so are not inputs to, or outputs of, the plan. There are some common situations for nested processes that will not be as simple as the above diagram. Thes include: Action makes a difference. When a piece of equipment or tool is \"used\", it is not gone at the end of the nesting process. But if it is managed as a time-based resource with a calendar, some calendar duration is in fact consumed. Or if a citable resource is created and then cited inside, it is also still there at the end of the nesting process. Batch or lot size makes a difference. Suppose you have a requirement for 5 of some assembled item, and 4 of some input component are needed to make each item, 20 components in all. But the minimum batch size for the component is 100. Then 80 of the components will be left in inventory at the end of the nesting process, and that 80 will also an output of the outer process. Planning from a Recipe Plans can be generated from a recipe by scaling the recipe according to the demanded quantity of the end outputs. This is called a \"demand explosion\". The generation might take into account current inventories, batch sizes, etc., so it is not necessarily a \"pure\" reflection of the recipe. In addition, often plans are tweaked after generation from a recipe, depending on how firm and exact the recipe is. A manufacturing recipe might be more exact than a recipe for a more general business process. For these reasons, a plans is decoupled from the recipe that generated it in the vocabulary.

That definition is too limited. Its limitations include: Intellectual creations like designs are not scarce, yet they clearly are economic resources. They only become scarce when legally restricted by patents and copyrights. Air, water, and other products of nature are clearly economic resources, but they are not under the control of an agent unless they are legally restricted by ownership. However, by means of the invisible foot that accompanies the invisible hand, they are regularly degraded by enterprises, and not accounted for, classified as \u201cexternalities\u201d. We want to think of ourselves as participants in ecosystems, not competing enterprises. As such, we need to account for our effects on all aspects of our ecosystem. And we want knowledge to be freely available. Also, we prefer to think of use value, but economic resources also often have exchange value. The difference between a resource and its specification/classification(s) An economic resource is observable. Its specification or classification defines what kind of thing the economic resource is. So, for example, most listings of things offered for sale on an e-commerce site are specifications, which can be searched using classifications. The one in a box delivered to your door is a resource. Or the description of the book entitled \"The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language\", ISBN-13: 978-0060520854, is a specification. Your library may have two copies that you can check out. Those are resources. The difference between a resource specification and a resource classification An economic resource or a flow can have only one resource specification in Valueflows. This defines the lowest level useful type or kind of the resource that is needed. The Valueflows vocabulary defines this as the ResourceSpecification. Note that often taxonomies and other references on the web can define very specific resource specifications at their leaf levels, and these can be used if the necessary properties can be found. Note also that for specific global identifiers such as GTIN, we recommend using properties of the GoodRelations ProductOrServiceModel . An economic resource or a flow can have any number of resource classifications . They are used to filter, match, or group economic resources. Resource classifications can be part of a taxonomy. That means they can be defined very broadly and generally and maybe vaguely, or they can be defined very narrowly, but fit into broader classifications. So, for example, you may want an apple. Or you may want a green apple. Or you may want a Granny Smith apple. Or, Herb is the parent classification of Anise Hyssop, Goldenrod, Nettles, Red Clover, etc. Besides its usefulness in understanding taxonomies of resource types, this can be useful when one can define a general recipe that will work for many more specific kinds of resources. People can use the multitude of existing taxonomies for resource classifications, or can also create their own as needed. Resource classifications can also use other schemes, like facets or tags. The references to resource classifications are uri's, and not otherwise defined inside Valueflows. Identification and Behaviors of Resources Here are three different kinds of resources from the viewpoint of identification: serialized resources, where each individual instance has a unique identifier, lot-controlled resources, where each lot or batch has a unique identifier, but the lot or batch may contain many individual instances, and count or volume or stock resources, where individual instances are indistinguishable, or in the case of fluids, only exist on a molecular level. Serialized resources would fit the direct identification pattern. Lots can be split up, so the identification of a subset of a lot would require some other properties, such as location. Stock resources can only be described indirectly, by means of some combination of properties, such as specification and location. (Location is a complex ontology of its own: for example, in warehousing, a location is often composed of warehouse:room:aisle:row:tier.) The tracking identifier is used for serial numbers. Moreover, identification of resources will depend on scope and purpose. We want to allow each scope or context to define resources that they have relationships with, according to the combination of properties that works best for them, which might include which agent has which relationship with a resource. And then in the \"independent view\", for larger-scale analysis of resource flows, or for example for lot tracking for public health issues like mad cow disease, different combinations of properties might be needed. Substitutability : This defines if any resources of that specification can be freely substituted for any other resource of that same specification when used, consumed, traded, etc. For example, one container of \"B9R-1-red DLP resin photopolymer\" is probably substitutable for another container of the same photopolymer. While each resource for a resource specification called \"English-Spanish translation\" is probably not substitutable because each will be a different document. Unique identifiers for resources This can vary. And people can be allowed within some boundaries of agreement to specify which combination of other properties would constitute identifiers. Here are some examples from manufacturing situations: Unique identifier = an assigned serialized identifier, which is unique across manufacturers, due to agreements in an industry. Examples are computers, vehicles, and other equipment. Unique identifier = resource model + lot identifier + location + owner: so in other words, the owner of the rights was part of the unique identifier of the resource, and if the resource got transferred from one owner to another, the first owner's resources would be decremented, and the second owner's resources would be incremented. Note in the last case, a transfer of rights means a different resource. This is common with resources that are not serialized, where one logical resource has a quantity greater than 1, and the individual instances are substitutable. (Think nuts and bolts, grain, strawberries, bottles of beer in cases, etc.) Stage and state Sometimes part of the logical identification of a resource includes: stage : the ProcessSpecification of the most recent process the resource was output from, with the modify action state : the state of the resource on output from a process, such as \"failed\" Stage is used when the same resource passes through multiple processes in its lifetime, and that information is needed by the next process to determine which resources can be valid inputs. For example, in creating a translation, you might have one translated document pass through translation, editing, proofreading, and formatting stages. You don't want to bring that resource into the formatting stage until it has been proofread, for example. Or you might have a testing stage for a component or product, in which case you don't want to consume or transfer the resource until it both has been through the testing stage, and had a pass output state. These can be defined on the recipe or the plan, showing where an input flow expects a certain stage and/or state of a resource. In that case, Dependent demand planning will select only those resources that fit the specified stage and state. In user-interface forms for adding EconomicEvents, the input event form should query EconomicResources for required stage and state when offering selections of possible input resources. The stage and state of an EconomicResource can be derived or stored, as preferred. Inventory Economic Resources can be inventoried, not inventoried but could be, or it doesn't make sense to think about inventory. If a resource is not inventoried, it is generally not instantiated in the software, but defined using resource specification and other properties, such as the accountable agent or location. Inventoried: You want to keep track of it, its changes in quantity, and how many you have right now. Not inventoried: You could keep track of it, but it isn't worth it. This usually happens for quantities of small or hard to measure items that are obtained in bulk, like solder or bolts. In this case, you have to look at the actual resource to see if you need more, the data won't tell you. Not applicable: This is for types of work (unless scheduled), services, and other resources where it just doesn't make sense. How resources relate to events In the original REA ontology, an Economic Event is a change in the quantity or in the rights to an Economic Resource performed by Economic Agents. An event is also defined by its behavior in relation to the resource (consume, use, produce, transfer, etc.). Some people use the terms \"stock\" and \"stock flow\". A stock is a resource; a stock flow is an event. (The term stock is too limiting, since a resource could be digital, like a document or media file.) An event can trigger incrementing or decrementing a resource. Sometimes it does neither, as in the case of using a piece of equipment or citing a document. But in any case, the quantity of a resource related to the event is not a resource itself, it is just a property of the event. For example a resource could be 100 widgets on a pallet, lot number 1234. If 10 of those widgets are consumed in a process that makes something out of them, that is an event: consumption of 10 widgets of lot number 1234. The 10 widgets are not a resource in their own right. The event triggers the decrement of the original resource of 100 widgets, which now has quantity of 90. For serialized or uniquely identified resources, if the logical and technical unique identifiers are not changed by an event, such as moving a vehicle to another location without any changes to its accountable agent (and assuming location is not part of the logical identifier), the resource does not behave like a stock and is not decremented or incremented. How resources relate to transfers Two different kinds of \"inventorying\" of resources are affected by transfers. quantity of the resource where the agent has full (human realm) rights and responsibilities, irrespective of custody quantity of the resource where the agent has custody or physical possession, irrespective of rights, more of an operational focus We define two current quantities on the economic resource for these two concepts, accounting quantity for the first and onhand quantity for the second. For example, in vendor-managed inventory, the vendor owns the inventory so they see it in their accounting; but the store sees it in their onhand quantities. Or for inventory being shipped FOB source, the intended receiver owns the inventory and sees it in their accounting, but the goods are actually onhand in a truck. How resources related to each other If one resource contains other resources, the contained resources are part of, or make up the larger resource. For example, a bank account might contain a number of \"virtual accounts\" that a group manages itself, outside the bank's knowledge. Or, a makerspace network might share packages of resources for projects, where the package moves as a whole, but the resources inside are what the project used. Or, a bike shed resource might contain 10 bikes, which are identified and tracked by their serial numbers as individual resources.","title":"Economic Resources"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#definition","text":"Traditionally, an economic resource is defined by its utility, but also by its scarcity and its control by an economic agent. That definition is too limited. Its limitations include: Intellectual creations like designs are not scarce, yet they clearly are economic resources. They only become scarce when legally restricted by patents and copyrights. Air, water, and other products of nature are clearly economic resources, but they are not under the control of an agent unless they are legally restricted by ownership. However, by means of the invisible foot that accompanies the invisible hand, they are regularly degraded by enterprises, and not accounted for, classified as \u201cexternalities\u201d. We want to think of ourselves as participants in ecosystems, not competing enterprises. As such, we need to account for our effects on all aspects of our ecosystem. And we want knowledge to be freely available. Also, we prefer to think of use value, but economic resources also often have exchange value.","title":"Definition"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#the-difference-between-a-resource-and-its-specificationclassifications","text":"An economic resource is observable. Its specification or classification defines what kind of thing the economic resource is. So, for example, most listings of things offered for sale on an e-commerce site are specifications, which can be searched using classifications. The one in a box delivered to your door is a resource. Or the description of the book entitled \"The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language\", ISBN-13: 978-0060520854, is a specification. Your library may have two copies that you can check out. Those are resources.","title":"The difference between a resource and its specification/classification(s)"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#the-difference-between-a-resource-specification-and-a-resource-classification","text":"An economic resource or a flow can have only one resource specification in Valueflows. This defines the lowest level useful type or kind of the resource that is needed. The Valueflows vocabulary defines this as the ResourceSpecification. Note that often taxonomies and other references on the web can define very specific resource specifications at their leaf levels, and these can be used if the necessary properties can be found. Note also that for specific global identifiers such as GTIN, we recommend using properties of the GoodRelations ProductOrServiceModel . An economic resource or a flow can have any number of resource classifications . They are used to filter, match, or group economic resources. Resource classifications can be part of a taxonomy. That means they can be defined very broadly and generally and maybe vaguely, or they can be defined very narrowly, but fit into broader classifications. So, for example, you may want an apple. Or you may want a green apple. Or you may want a Granny Smith apple. Or, Herb is the parent classification of Anise Hyssop, Goldenrod, Nettles, Red Clover, etc. Besides its usefulness in understanding taxonomies of resource types, this can be useful when one can define a general recipe that will work for many more specific kinds of resources. People can use the multitude of existing taxonomies for resource classifications, or can also create their own as needed. Resource classifications can also use other schemes, like facets or tags. The references to resource classifications are uri's, and not otherwise defined inside Valueflows.","title":"The difference between a resource specification and a resource classification"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#identification-and-behaviors-of-resources","text":"Here are three different kinds of resources from the viewpoint of identification: serialized resources, where each individual instance has a unique identifier, lot-controlled resources, where each lot or batch has a unique identifier, but the lot or batch may contain many individual instances, and count or volume or stock resources, where individual instances are indistinguishable, or in the case of fluids, only exist on a molecular level. Serialized resources would fit the direct identification pattern. Lots can be split up, so the identification of a subset of a lot would require some other properties, such as location. Stock resources can only be described indirectly, by means of some combination of properties, such as specification and location. (Location is a complex ontology of its own: for example, in warehousing, a location is often composed of warehouse:room:aisle:row:tier.) The tracking identifier is used for serial numbers. Moreover, identification of resources will depend on scope and purpose. We want to allow each scope or context to define resources that they have relationships with, according to the combination of properties that works best for them, which might include which agent has which relationship with a resource. And then in the \"independent view\", for larger-scale analysis of resource flows, or for example for lot tracking for public health issues like mad cow disease, different combinations of properties might be needed. Substitutability : This defines if any resources of that specification can be freely substituted for any other resource of that same specification when used, consumed, traded, etc. For example, one container of \"B9R-1-red DLP resin photopolymer\" is probably substitutable for another container of the same photopolymer. While each resource for a resource specification called \"English-Spanish translation\" is probably not substitutable because each will be a different document.","title":"Identification and Behaviors of Resources"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#unique-identifiers-for-resources","text":"This can vary. And people can be allowed within some boundaries of agreement to specify which combination of other properties would constitute identifiers. Here are some examples from manufacturing situations: Unique identifier = an assigned serialized identifier, which is unique across manufacturers, due to agreements in an industry. Examples are computers, vehicles, and other equipment. Unique identifier = resource model + lot identifier + location + owner: so in other words, the owner of the rights was part of the unique identifier of the resource, and if the resource got transferred from one owner to another, the first owner's resources would be decremented, and the second owner's resources would be incremented. Note in the last case, a transfer of rights means a different resource. This is common with resources that are not serialized, where one logical resource has a quantity greater than 1, and the individual instances are substitutable. (Think nuts and bolts, grain, strawberries, bottles of beer in cases, etc.)","title":"Unique identifiers for resources"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#stage-and-state","text":"Sometimes part of the logical identification of a resource includes: stage : the ProcessSpecification of the most recent process the resource was output from, with the modify action state : the state of the resource on output from a process, such as \"failed\" Stage is used when the same resource passes through multiple processes in its lifetime, and that information is needed by the next process to determine which resources can be valid inputs. For example, in creating a translation, you might have one translated document pass through translation, editing, proofreading, and formatting stages. You don't want to bring that resource into the formatting stage until it has been proofread, for example. Or you might have a testing stage for a component or product, in which case you don't want to consume or transfer the resource until it both has been through the testing stage, and had a pass output state. These can be defined on the recipe or the plan, showing where an input flow expects a certain stage and/or state of a resource. In that case, Dependent demand planning will select only those resources that fit the specified stage and state. In user-interface forms for adding EconomicEvents, the input event form should query EconomicResources for required stage and state when offering selections of possible input resources. The stage and state of an EconomicResource can be derived or stored, as preferred.","title":"Stage and state"},{"location":"concepts/resources/#inventory","text":"Economic Resources can be inventoried, not inventoried but could be, or it doesn't make sense to think about inventory. If a resource is not inventoried, it is generally not instantiated in the software, but defined using resource specification and other properties, such as the accountable agent or location. Inventoried: You want to keep track of it, its changes in quantity, and how many you have right now. Not inventoried: You could keep track of it, but it isn't worth it. This usually happens for quantities of small or hard to measure items that are obtained in bulk, like solder or bolts. In this case, you have to look at the actual resource to see if you need more, the data won't tell you.

An economic event, commitment or intent can reference any number of entities which scope it. It is not required that events, commitments, or intents designate a scope. In fact, sometimes the scope is the same as the provider or recipient agent. Or sometimes there is no useful scope. For functions that require traversing value flows, often the value flow will cross from one scope to another. For example, perhaps another network or organization makes a component that you consume when making your product. When this happens, there are some options. Standing agreements can govern what happens. A conversation for action might be required to determine what should occur for the specific instance. Accounting Accounting is usually done for an agent or other bounded scope. Where a computer system supports one enterprise, this is simple. When a computer system supports many organizations or there is a distributed network of economic activity, it is useful to be able to segregate the accounting using scope. It basically enables multi-party accounting in a networked scenario. Planning Sometimes a generic recipe will cross scope boundaries for particular agents. For example one agent could produce a resource that consumes a component made by another agent. In this case, can the first agent schedule the production of the component by the second agent? Possibly yes, if there are agreements in place for that, and the first agent has verified that inventory does not already exist. Or possibly, based again on agreements, the first agent can assume the second agent will provide the component, with the second agent taking responsibility for checking if it is onhand, and if not, scheduling it for production. Distributing Incoming Resources Some organizations distribute income backwards on value flows, based on people's contributions to the resources that generated the income. When traversing the value chain, it is useful to know when the traversal has crossed a scope boundary, because it is possible that the rules for distributing the incoming resources will change for a different scope.

A second kind is an activity that operationally changes physical custody or possession of an economic resource from one agent to another, without affecting rights. Note that a transfer is a one-way activity. Two or more reciprocal transfers form an exchange. We think that now, and more so in the future, there will be more gradations of rights and responsibilities for resources than are sometimes considered now. For example, as a society we may decide that we should take more responsibility for recycling or upcycling resources at the end of their useful life for us, or not wasting them. The concept of \"ownership\" may transition more into \"stewardship\" in a concept of the world that does not put humans in a position of controlling the world's resources or abdicating responsibilities to the ecosystem in the name of ownership. So, we are for the most part avoiding talking about ownership in this vocabulary, as we work towards more of an ecosystemic perspective. Examples For example, perhaps some agent has many apple trees, and plans on pressing apple cider. Another agent has an apple press and agrees to transfer use of the press (a resource) in exchange for a reciprocal transfer of a portion of the apple cider. The use of the press involves some rights (to use the press for some period of time) and responsibilities (to not run it beyond its capacity and to clean it up before returning it). Or in a library, a book can be checked out, a transfer from the library to the reader. The agent who checks it out can read it and is responsible for caring for it and returning it on time, another transfer. Or let's say that a community has farmland and equipment held in common. The community transfers responsibility for the land and equipment to some farmers to use and take care of. The community also transfers seeds every year to the farmers, enough to grow the food the community needs. During the year, the harvests are distributed (transferred) to the community members for their consumption. In reciprocity, the community provides for other needs of the farmers. Implementation note : Different networks may choose to handle namespaces and identifiers at different granularity. This also may depend on the technology used. So one network may have separate namespaces for the nodes in the network; another may have one namespace for the whole network.

QT (\"quality testing\") gives pass and/or fail outputs. The failed components are passed back into a source resource (because it can be re-used as an input as part of the QT process, to be used in this or the next manufacturing run. The QT needs the stage and state of the input component resource, because QT would only be done on components that are made and not tested yet. By the same token, components would only be sent into the next assembly process if they have passed the QT process/stage (not part of this example).

The core is based on the REA (Resource, Event, Agent) ontology. You can find all the details by following the links here . These are the main concepts in the REA ontology, as pictured in this document : Economic events are the movers and shakers. They say what is happening to economic resources, and what economic agents are involved along the way. They create the \"value flows\". A key concept in REA is Duality, which means that each event wants one or more balancing events: in other words, some kind of reciprocity. REA uses an abstract word for this relationship in order to make the meaning configurable. The reciprocity does not need to happen at the same time, or in the same transaction. And it can have any logic that a network wants: payment in money, swap, earn credits, earn reputation points, share with the commons, from each according to ability and to each according to need, etc. Independent vs Dependent views Conventional accounting always takes the view of an individual agent: often a company. REA, and Valueflows, take an independent view, sometimes called a \u201ccollaboration space\u201d or economic network or supply chain view. At the same time, derived from the independent view, REA and Valueflows support each agent's own accounting view. For example, from one agent's viewpoint, the exchange may be a \"purchase\", from the other agent's viewpoint, it might be a \"sale\". From the neutral viewpoint, it is an exchange of resources, with usually at least two flows of resources, from different directions. For the individual agent\u2019s accounting systems, assuming an Exchange of goods for money, when the goods are transferred from the seller to the purchaser, the purchaser\u2019s Accounts Payable are increased (credited) and the seller\u2019s Accounts Receivable are increased (debited). The independent view sees a transfer of goods from one agent to another. While conventional accounting uses the individual agent view, larger-scale economic analyses and planning, like for networks, communities, and bioregions, use the independent view. See Value Flow Algorithms . Levels of the ontology All the levels of the REA ontology are similarly flexible and configurable: The Knowledge level represents classification, policies, procedures, rules and patterns. This is where each network or community can configure the core concepts to fit their desires. The Plan level represents offers, requests, schedules and promises. The Observation level represents what really happened. The core Valueflows vocabulary includes some concepts for which we use other rdf-based vocabularies.

The model must enable collaboration between different people in different organizations using different software on different platforms using different human and programming languages. The model must be able to form global networks which can track the flows of resources (values) forwards and backwards. Or maybe it would be better to say \"in any direction\", but forwards means in the direction of value creation, and backwards means in the direction of return or compensation. Corollary: the model must be able to support various fair methods of distribution of resources. The ability to find contributions to the network or the economy regardless of where and when in the network configuration those contributions occurred is key. The model must also be able to support coordinating work between different people in different organizations. People who are not concerned with rewards may still want to coordinate work. The model must be able to support circular economies, value flows where resources come full cycle to be fed into the same set or other processes. Recycling, re-use, and other ways to encourage resources not becoming waste, must be supported. Flows currently considered \"externalities\" should be able to be internalized in the model. The model must be fractal. It must support global views of networks in aggregate as well as drilling down to lower and lower levels of detail. Those lower levels of detail, for example inside one organization, may require permissions. The model must also work on the Knowledge, Plan and Observation levels, where the objects on each level are linked appropriately to the other levels.
