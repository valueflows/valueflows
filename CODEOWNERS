# https://help.github.com/articles/about-code-owners/
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own.
# When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews,
# they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository.

This is a loosely organized project, there are not "owners".  Who is a maintainer at any point has been managed informally.  See the Contributors page in the doc for people who are or have been involved.
