Here is the current release spec, which also includes concepts: https://valueflo.ws/

Some specific links of interest for devs:

* [Classes and Properties] For a diagram view of the whole model, see [this complete diagram](https://www.valueflo.ws/assets/ValueFlowsUML.png), or [this subject area breakout with diagrams and text explanations](https://www.valueflo.ws/specification/model-text/).
* [RDF Reference](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/pages/src/branch/main/assets/all_vf.TTL)  This is the "turtle" file that is the system of record source for the specification.
* [GraphQL Reference](https://lab.allmende.io/valueflows/vf-schemas/vf-graphql/-/tree/sprout/lib/schemas).  This is maintained mostly by the projects using it.  It is currently somewhat out of sync.
* Other alternative formats are in various stages of completion, ask in the Valueflows welcome chat, linked below.
* [Procedures for moving changes to the website](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/src/branch/master/Website-publishing-instructions.md).
