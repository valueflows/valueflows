![Valueflows icon](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/raw/branch/master/mkdocs/docs/assets/icon-0.svg)

Here is the current release spec, which also includes concepts: https://valueflo.ws/

Some specific links of interest for devs:

* [Classes and Properties](https://w3id.org/lode/owlapi/https://codeberg.org/valueflows/pages/raw/branch/main/assets/all_vf.TTL).  This is the standard specification format. For a diagram view of the whole model, see [this diagram](https://www.valueflo.ws/assets/ValueFlowsUML.png).
* [Other Namespaces/Terms](https://www.valueflo.ws/specification/external-terms/).  This references the other vocabulary elements that are also necessary for a complete value flows economic model.  There are only a few left at this point.
* [RDF Reference](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/pages/src/branch/main/assets/all_vf.TTL)  This is the "turtle" file that is the system of record source for the specification.
* [GraphQL Reference](https://lab.allmende.io/valueflows/vf-schemas/vf-graphql/-/tree/sprout/lib/schemas).  This is maintained mostly by the projects using it.  It is currently somewhat our of sync.
* [JSON-schema Reference](https://www.valueflo.ws/specification/json-schemas/).  This is not complete, but contains the core of VF.  It will be worked on further as needed.
* [Procedures for moving changes to the website](https://codeberg.org/valueflows/valueflows/Website-publishing-procedure.md).
